# 🧠 AgentCompute — Decentralized AI Compute Marketplace on Hedera

AgentCompute is a decentralized platform that connects AI researchers with compute suppliers using idle CPU resources. Powered by Hedera smart contracts, IPFS, and autonomous supplier agents, it enables secure, trustless execution of compute jobs with real-time HBAR payments.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🖥️ **Autonomous Supplier Daemons** – Background agents that auto-fetch, process, and submit jobs
- 🔗 **Smart Contract Escrow** – Hedera-based job escrow and payment system
- 🧾 **IPFS File Storage** – Secure storage of job inputs and results
- 📊 **Live Dashboards** – Researcher & supplier portals with real-time status and earnings
- 💸 **HBAR Payments** – Trustless compensation for verified compute output

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity on Hedera
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + TailwindCSS
- **Daemon Agent**: Node.js / C
- **Storage**: IPFS (Web3.Storage)

## 🌍 Vision
AgentCompute creates a decentralized, autonomous, and scalable compute economy—aligning idle machines with AI demand, while removing centralized control and manual coordination.
